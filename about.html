      <h2>Who we are</h2>
      <p>
        Lepus Foundation is a non-profit organization that is currently working
        to save wildlife species around the world. We are currently
        collaborating with other wildlife preservation organizations to help
        restore the habitats of the wildlife.

      <h2>Our mission</h2>

      <p>
        Our mission is to help save our wildlife from facing extinction and to
        also to bring safety & sanctuary to those who are facing problems from
        deforestation to poaching, pollution, cutting down forests, and climate
        change. The Earth is not going to heal itself. That's why we need to
        raise awareness about the critical state of our wildlife. Our mission
        addresses UN goals 13, 14, and 15. Climate action, Life below water, and
        Life on land. By working to achieve these goals, we can have a better
        habitat for animals to live in.

      <h2>The Problem</h2>

      <p>
        Many animals are losing their homes due to people cutting down forest,
        pollution, poaching, and climate change. The earth is a system. If one
        of the system's parts stops functioning properly, it crashes. This is
        why it is important to save our wildlife! It matters because the Earth
        is in a critical state right now. If we don't do something now, we will
        continue to lose more and more of our wildlife.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="border">
      <h2>The solution</h2>
      <p>
        There are many ways that we can help save our wildlife. We need to get
        it out there that the animals are dying because they have no clean and
        safe habitat. We can let the people help out by planting trees, picking
        up trash, using renewable energy sources, and adopting animals. We hope
        to give the wildlife a proper habitat and safe place to live out in the
        wild which will help save the wildlife.
