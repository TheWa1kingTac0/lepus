        We have finally launched our new app! with our new app it will be able
        to let you take a picture of an animal & with our machine taught
        technology it will be able to tell you facts about that animal! Some of
        these facts include their habitat, status in the wild, How these animals
        act in their environment, how to treat & protect them, & additional
        trivia! We hope you use & love this app & see you all next time on our
